# C-_with_dotnet_and_SQL

I tried integrating SQL with C# use the following commands to follow and repeat the process (install dotnet on your device first):

1. Change to your home directory. Create a new .NET Core project. This will create the project directory with a basic .NET Core Program.cs and csproj file.
`dotnet new console -o SqlServerColumnstoreSample`
